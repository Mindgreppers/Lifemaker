        <h1>LifeMaker</h1>
        <p>Collaborative awakening</p>
        <p>Today, the brightness of Human intellect is dulled by ignorance and division, leading to misery at all facets of life. For those who realize this, LifeMaker is a platform for collaborative awakening to alleviate our misery right from its roots. It is a desire and a call to action for everyone to unite and help every human (including Oneself) glow in the light of wisdom, contentment, health and prosperity</p>
        <h2>The platform will facilitate:-</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluation and evolution of our lives based on feedback from our environment</li>
          <li>Skill and interest based connection and collaboration</li>
          <li>Resource Mobilization for meaningful project and valued member.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LifeMaker is a completely <strong>community owned</strong>, <strong>open source </strong>platform, <strong>sustained </strong> by the community itself.</p>
        <p>There are millions of us following the same philosophy in life, albeit to a varying degree. We are all spread across the world, doing our things. Today, we have the resource of technology to help us connect and collaborate better. To start with, we have launched an open source Android application (Beta expected around February end). <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifemaker" class="white">We invite testers to test it </a>out before the beta launch!></p>

              <h3>Self Discovery</h3>
              <p>The root cause of Human misery is ignorance of our True nature of Oneness and hence division of me versus the other. Those who realize and live by this fundamental truth are sources of wisdom (and hence compassion). This would mean end of the unnecessary conflicts and the beginning of productive collaborations.</p>

              <h3>Measuring the impact</h3>
              <p>In order to evolve, we need to learn from the outcome of our actions. How does one get to evaluate the impact of one's life on the environment? How does one decide whether to trust a stranger for something important? How do we elect people for positions of power? How does one measure global happiness? All of this can happen through people saying Thanks or NoThanks to those whose acts they appreciate or disapprove.</p>

              <h3>Interest based connect</h3>
              <p>When in need to get something done, how do you find the right person for any job? Are not one's choices limited by the size of one's personal social network? If people express their skills and interests, each SmokeSignal can reach out to the relevant audience based on match of its content with their interests and skills.</p>

              <h3>Rewarding the goodwill</h3>
              <p>To a varying degree, we all are generating meaningful value in our lives. We do this by way of collaboration for a larger cause, personal help to someone, knowledge or resource share. Shouldn't the people or projects which are doing good work (and earning goodwill) in the society be sustained by the society itself? Shouldn't they also be holding positions of responsibility? </p>

            <p>Smoke Signals are our tribe’s primary channel to share, express and connect. They are broadcasted messages to the entire Network.</p>

            <h2>Live</h2>
            <p>We live in a world where everything is transient and so are SmokeSignal. SmokeSignals on LifeMaker are just like their physical counterpart. They both require wood and last only as long as the wood keeps burning. So there is no communication is permanently active on LifeMaker.

            <h2>Wood</h2>
            <p>Wood is our medium of exchange and sustainance within and without LifeMaker. The way to get more wood into your stock is by getting appreciation from other members of the network. Donating to LifeMaker foundation also gets you more wood. You can use this wood to partially fund your own living, to exchange with other members of the network, to light Smoke Signals or to fund a project that you like.

            <h2>Thanks</h2>
            <p>People acknowledge each other’s activities by saying ‘Thanks’ or NoThanks. By saying ‘Thanks’ you gift some of your own wood. This ensures genuine appreciation. You can also say ‘No Thanks’, when you find something counter productive, by sacrificing your own wood.

            <h2>Karma</h2>
            <p> Karma helps you look back and see the impact that you’ve had on the environment through your activities. Your Karma increases when people say 'Thanks', and decreases on receiving a 'No Thanks'. Over the course of time we expect Karma to stand for people’s goodwill, and to be a measure for allocation of responsibility.

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <h3>Currently the app is in alpha and we invite initial testers, and here is what it supports.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Send Smoke Signals</li>
          <li>See live SmokeSignals based on your interests</li>
          <li>See all live SmokeSignals</li>
          <li>Smoke Signals get turned off automatically based on the amount of wood allocated</li>
          <li>Thank or Nothank someone</li>
          <li>On Thanks, the thanker gifts one log of wood to the thanked One. The thanker's Karma increases by 1, and the Good One's karma increases by 5</li>
          <li>The NoThanker 'sacrifices' a log of his wood when saying NoThanks. The reciever's Karma decreases by 5</li>
          <li>Can edit your interests and profile fields by visiting profile and updating it</li>
          <li>Can see any One's (or your Self's) wood and karma and Smoke Signals on the profile</li>

          <li>Add anonymous mode so that user's can hide their identity when communicating or thanking.</li>
          <li>Launch a web app</li>
          <li>Integrate Facebook and twitter accounts. Allow to easily add those contacts to interests.</li>
