                <h1>LifeMaker</h1>
                <h2><i>Collaborative awakening</i></h2>
                <p class="font-small">Today, the brightness of Human intellect is dulled by ignorance and division, leading to misery at all facets of life. For those who realize this, LifeMaker is a platform for collaborative awakening to alleviate our misery right from its roots. It is a desire and a call to action for everyone <i>to unite, to care and to help</i> every human (including Oneself) glow in the light of wisdom, contentment, health and prosperity</p>
                <p class="font-small">The platform will facilitate:-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Evaluation and evolution of our lives based on feedback from our environment</li>
                    <li>Skill and interest based connection and collaboration</li>
                    <li>Resource mobilization to support meaningful projects and valued members.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="font-small">LifeMaker is a completely <strong class="blue">community owned</strong>, <strong class="blue">open source </strong> and <strong class="blue">self-sustaining</strong> platform.</p>
                <p class="font-small">
                    There are millions of us subscribing to the same philosophy in life. We are spread across the world, not knowing each other or the work we are doing. Today we have the resource of technology to help us discover each other, our works and ideas. And to come together in an organized and sustainable way.To start with, we have launched an open source Android application (Beta expected around February end).
                    <br/>
                    <br/><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifemaker" class="white">We invite testers to test it </a>out before the beta launch!</p>

                            <h3>Going Back to the Roots</h3>
                            <p>The root cause of Human misery is ignorance of our True nature of Oneness and hence division of me versus the other. Those who realize and live by this fundamental truth are sources of wisdom (and hence compassion). This would mean end of the unnecessary conflicts and the beginning of productive collaborations.</p>

                            <h3>Measuring Impact of Our Living</h3>
                            <p>In order to evolve, we need to learn from the outcome of our actions. How does one get to evaluate the impact of one's life on the environment? How does one decide whether to trust a stranger for something important? How do we elect people for positions of power? How does one measure global happiness? All of this can happen through people saying Thanks or NoThanks to those whose acts they appreciate or disapprove.</p>

                            <h3>Connecting Smartly</h3>
                            <p>When in need to get something done, how do you find the right person for any job? Are not one's choices limited by the size of one's personal social network? If people express their skills and interests, each SmokeSignal can reach out to the relevant audience based on match of its content with their interests and skills.</p>

                            <h3>Gratitude and Sharing Based Sustenance</h3>
                            <p>To a varying degree, we all are generating meaningful value in our lives. We do this by way of collaboration for a larger cause, personal help to someone, knowledge or resource share. Shouldn't the people or projects which are doing good work (and earning goodwill) in the society be sustained by the society itself? Shouldn't they also be holding positions of responsibility? </p>

The way to get more wood into your stock is by getting appreciation from other members of the network. In future, donating to LifeMaker foundation also gets you more wood. You will be able to use this wood to fund a project, to exchange with other members of the network, to light Smoke Signals or to fulfill your basic needs.

Your Karma increases when people say 'Thanks', and decreases on receiving a 'No Thanks'. Over the course of time we expect Karma to stand for people’s goodwill, and to be a measure for allocation of responsibility.
